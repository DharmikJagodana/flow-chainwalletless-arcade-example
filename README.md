This is example Flow App was created to demonstrate walletless onboarding and promote composable, secure, and smooth UX for on-chain games without the need for a traditional backend. It uses an on-chain Rock Paper Scissors game and NFT "Marketplace" as a proof of concept exploration into the world of blockchain gaming and hybrid custody powered by Cadence on Flow.

cd walletless-arcade-example
```

### Pre-Requisites

**1. Install Flow CLI**

Follow [installation instructions](https://developers.flow.com/tooling/flow-cli/install) to install Flow CLI on to your machine.

**2. Copy `emulator.private.json.example` and `testnet.private.json.example`**

```sh
cp emulator.private.json.example emulator.private.json
cp testnet.private.json.example testnet.private.json
```

:bookmark: Update with your own key data.

**3. Copy the .env-example file to .env and update the required values.**

```

:warning: App requires several `env` vars for development and deployment. Credentials and API keys can be acquired through their respective providers. See `.env-example` for details

#### Service Providers

- Stripe (Used for NFT Purchase): [https://stripe.com/docs/development](https://stripe.com/docs/development)
- Google (Used as Next Auth Provider): [https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect)

### Run Demo Locally

- Start the emulator

```sh
flow emulator start
```

- Start the Dev Wallet (From a new terminal window)

```sh
flow dev-wallet
```

- Start dev server to deploy the contracts and configure the service account (From a new terminal window) - this will create our emulator deployment accounts, transfer our dev account some $FLOW, and configure initial resources

```sh
npm run dev:local:complete
```

This command will start the dev server and deploy the contracts to the emulator. It will also configure the service account with the required capabilities.

### Deployment

Refer to `testnet-account` deployment from `flow.json` to deploy required contracts to your own game admin account.
This account will need a Flow balance for use in account creation and transaction fees.

Once contracts are deployed to your admin accounts, update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ADDRESS` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_KEY_INDEX` env vars in your on your deployment platform.

Run the following transaction to configure the admin account with the required capabilities:

```shell
flow transactions send --network=testnet --signer testnet-account cadence/transactions/child_account/setup_child_account_creator.cdc
```
